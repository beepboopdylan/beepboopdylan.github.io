![Crazy Eights!](/images/portfolio/crazy8.png)

This is one of the first games I made. Essentially, the rules are that you have 7 cards, and for each turn, you have to match a card in your hand to the faceup card either by rank or suit. If you get a Crazy 8, you can choose to switch the current suit. If you run out of cards, you win! If the deck runs out, the player with the fewest cards left in their hand wins.

This game was coded entirely in **Java** and leveraged object-oriented programming. Happy playing - humanity depends on you!
