During the fall of 2024, I worked as a software engineer intern at [Annarabic](https://www.annarabic.com/). Annarabic is a Moroccan-based AI startup that produces speech-recognition technology for spoken Arabic dialects, focusing primarily on Moroccan Arabic but now expanding to all Arabic dialects and some African languages like Swahili.
