As part of my Data Structures capstone project, I implemented three types of data structures for searching a list of words for anagrams, leveraging polymorphism:

- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
- **AVL Tree** (self-balancing)
- **Hash Table**

This project demonstrated the trade-offs between different data structures in terms of search time, insertion complexity, and memory usage.
