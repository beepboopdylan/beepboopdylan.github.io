I want to understand the world through data, and make that process secure.

### Currently

- I'm a Machine Learning Research Intern at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/), working on Bluesky + SAEs as the only undergraduate in [Dr. Nikhil Garg's AI Lab](https://gargnikhil.com/). My work was made possible by [Google](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/research-innovation/institutes-centers-initiatives/computational-sciences-ai/cyber-nyc-initiative).
- I'm a senior at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Linguistics. I'm graduating in May 2026.

### Previously

I worked on frontend engineering at [echo3D](/portfolio/echo3d), and product engineering & business development at [Annarabic](/portfolio/annarabic). I was also selected to be a Winter Defense Tech Fellow at [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/), where I developed a project approach for intelligence gathering in sparse data regions using few-shot learning and satellite data.

At [Columbia](/portfolio/columbia), I was the Cybersecurity Competitions Chair for [CUCyber](https://cucyber.cs.columbia.edu/). I was also an analyst in [Columbia Emerging Markets Society](https://www.columbiaemergingmarketssociety.com/) focusing on the Middle East and North Africa region.
