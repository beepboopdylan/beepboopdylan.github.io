In Spring 2024, I had the honor of serving as Program Coordinator for the [Woodenfish Foundation](https://www.woodenfishfoundation.org/home) and [Columbia University Department of Religion](https://religion.columbia.edu/content/buddhism), where I coordinated a historic visit from [Venerable Dr. Yifa, PhD.](https://asiacenter.harvard.edu/venerable-yifa) and an international delegation of over 20 Buddhist monks and nuns to Columbia University.

## The Mission

The primary goal of this visit was twofold:
1. Facilitate meaningful religious dialogue between the visiting monastics and Columbia faculty
2. Empower monastics to pursue higher education and academic research

## The Experience

[Add your content here about what you did, what you learned, challenges you faced, memorable moments, etc.]

## Reflections

[Add your reflections on what this experience meant to you and what you took away from it]
