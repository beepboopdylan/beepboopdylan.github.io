In Spring 2024, I had the honor of serving as Program Coordinator for the [Woodenfish Foundation](https://www.woodenfishfoundation.org/home) and [Columbia University Department of Religion](https://religion.columbia.edu/content/buddhism), where I coordinated a historic visit from [Venerable Dr. Yifa, PhD.](https://asiacenter.harvard.edu/venerable-yifa) and an international delegation of over 20 Buddhist monks and nuns to Columbia University.
